### Assorted Comments and Resources
* If you don't know what Oath2 is.. why are you here?
* [Oath2 flow on slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/alvarosanchezmariscal/stateless-authentication-for-microservices/21).

### Installation

#### Download
* Download the latest release or clone from master.

#### Deploy
* This will deploy to [heroku with a postgres](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/ProductionHeroku) instance as is.
* You may also run `./jecommande run <port_number>` to run on server manually

### Extensibility
Coming soon
